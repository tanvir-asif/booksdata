      "review": "Educated by Tara Westover is an unforgettable memoir that captures the essence of self-transformation through the pursuit of knowledge. Born into a survivalist family in the mountains of Idaho, Westover grows up isolated from mainstream society, without any formal education. Despite this, her thirst for knowledge and understanding of the world beyond her family's farm is unquenchable. Westover's journey from her restrictive and abusive upbringing to earning a PhD from Cambridge University is nothing short of remarkable. This memoir is not just a story about education in the traditional sense but also about the education of the self and the relentless quest for a voice and identity in a world that seems alien. Westover's prose is compelling and raw, vividly painting the landscapes of her childhood and the emotional terrain she navigates as she seeks to understand her place in the world. Educated is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of learning, making it a profound and inspiring read.",
